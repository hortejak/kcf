# KCF tracker – parallel and PREM implementations

The goal of this project is modify KCF tracker for use in the
[HERCULES][1] project, where it will run on NVIDIA TX2 board. To
achieve the needed performance we try various ways of parallelization
of the algorithm including execution on the GPU. The aim is also to
modify the code according to the PRedictable Execution Model (PREM).

Stable version of the tracker is available from [CTU server][2],
development happens at [GitHub][3].

## Prerequisites

The code depends on OpenCV 2.4 library
and [CMake][13] (optionally with [Ninja][8]) is used for building.
Depending on the version to be compiled you need to have development
packages for [FFTW][4], [CUDA][5] or [OpenMP][6] installed.

On TX2, the following command should install what's needed:
``` shellsession
$ apt install cmake ninja-build libopencv-dev libfftw3-dev
```

[5]: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
[6]: http://www.openmp.org/
[13]: https://cmake.org/

## Compilation

There are multiple ways how to compile the code.

### Compile all supported versions

``` shellsession
$ git submodule update --init
$ make -k
```

This will create several `build-*` directories and compile different
versions in them. If prerequisites of some builds are missing, the
`-k` option ensures that the errors are ignored. This uses [Ninja][8]
build system, which is useful when building naively on TX2, because
builds with `ninja` are faster (better parallelized) than with `make`.

To build only a specific version run `make <version>`. For example,
CUDA-based version can be compiled with:

``` shellsession
$ make cufft
```

[8]: https://ninja-build.org/

### Using cmake gui

```shellsession
$ git submodule update --init
$ mkdir build
$ cmake-gui .
```

- Use the just created build directory as "Where to build the
  binaries".
- Press "Configure".
- Choose desired build options. Each option has a comment briefly
  explaining what it does.
- Press "Generate" and close the window.

```shellsession
$ make -C build
```
### Command line

```shellsession
$ git submodule update --init
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake [options] ..  # see the tables below
$ make
```

The `cmake` options below allow to select, which version to build.

The following table shows how to configure different FFT
implementations.

|Option| Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-DFFT=OpenCV` | Use OpenCV to calculate FFT.|
| `-DFFT=fftw` | Use fftw and its `plan_many` and "New-array execute" functions. If `std::async`, OpenMP or cuFFTW is not used the plans will use 2 threads by default.|
| `-DFFT=cuFFTW` | Use cuFFTW interface to cuFFT library.|
| `-DFFT=cuFFT` | Use cuFFT. This version also uses pure CUDA implementation of `ComplexMat` class and Gaussian correlation.|

With all of these FFT version additional options can be added:

|Option| Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-DASYNC=ON` | Use C++ `std::async` to run computations for different scales in parallel. This doesn't work with `BIG_BATCH` mode.|
| `-DBIG_BATCH=ON` | Concatenate matrices of different scales to one big matrix and perform all computations on this matrix. This mode doesn't work with `OpenCV` FFT.|
| `-DOPENMP=ON` | Parallelize certain operation with OpenMP. This can only be used with `OpenCV` or `fftw` FFT implementations. By default it runs computations for differenct scales in parallel. With `-DBIG_BATCH=ON` it parallelizes the feature extraction and the search for maximal response for differenct scales. With `fftw`, Ffftw's plans will execute in parallel.|
| `-DCUDA_DEBUG=ON` | Adds calls cudaDeviceSynchronize after every CUDA function and kernel call.|
| `-DOpenCV_DIR=/opt/opencv-3.3/share/OpenCV` | Compile against a custom OpenCV version. |


### Compilation for non-TX2 CUDA

The CuFFT version is set up to run on NVIDIA Jetson TX2. If you want
to run it on different architecture, change the `--gpu-architecture
sm_62` NVCC flag in **/src/CMakeLists.txt** to your architecture of
NVIDIA GPU. To find what SM variation you architecture has look
[here][9].

## Running

No matter which method is used to compile the code, the results will
be `kcf_vot` binary.

It operates on an image sequence created according to [VOT 2014
methodology][10]. You can find some image sequences in [vot2016
datatset][11].

The binary can be run as follows:

1. `./kcf_vot [options]`

   The program looks for `groundtruth.txt` or `region.txt` and
   `images.txt` files in current directory.

   - `images.txt` contains a list of images to process, each on a
     separate line.
   - `groundtruth.txt` contains the correct location of the tracked
     object in each image as four corner points listed clockwise
     starting from bottom left corner. Only the first line from this
     file is used.
   - `region.txt` is an alternative way of specifying the location of
     the object to track via its bounding box (top_left_x, top_left_y,
     width, height) in the first frame.

2. `./kcf_vot [options] <directory>`

   Looks for `groundtruth.txt` or `region.txt` and `images.txt` files
   in the given `directory`.

3. `./kcf_vot [options] <path/to/region.txt or groundtruth.txt> <path/to/images.txt> [path/to/output.txt]`

By default the program generates file `output.txt` containing the
bounding boxes of the tracked object in the format "top_left_x,
top_left_y, width, height".

### Options

| Options | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| --visualize, -v[delay_ms] | Visualize the output, optionally with specified delay. If the delay is 0 the program will wait for a key press. |
| --output, -o <output.txt>	 | Specify name of output file. |
| --debug, -d				 | Generate debug output. |
| --fit, -f[W[xH]] | Specifies the dimension to which the extracted patch should be scaled. It should be divisible by 4. No dimension is the same as `128x128`, a single dimension `W` will result in patch size of `W`×`W`. |
